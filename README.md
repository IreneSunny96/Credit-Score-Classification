# Credit-Score-Classification
## Overview : 
This project is part of the Multi-Class Credit Score Classification Kaggle Challenge that aimed to develop an advanced machine learning model to categorize clients into distinct credit score brackets. The model was designed using a dataset that included demographic information, banking history, utilization, and payment behavior. Below is the description given by the Kaggle Challenge Organisers

## Business Challenge:
The top brass (your management) has laid down a strategic initiative: to streamline the credit assessment process. They envisage an automated system that can swiftly and accurately categorize clients into distinct credit score brackets, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the credit evaluation process and enabling more informed decision-making.

## Your Objective:
Your task is to develop a sophisticated machine-learning model that leverages the wealth of credit-related information at your disposal to classify clients into appropriate credit score brackets. This system should serve as a robust analytical tool that aids in the accurate assessment of credit risks and the allocation of credit scores.
Get ready to dive into the data, draw insights, and deploy your modelâ€”the future of credit scoring at Global Finance Inc. rests in your capable hands. Let the challenge commence!

## Info:
As part of our credit score classification challenge, we have at our disposal a dataset that serves as a financial footprint of our customers. This dataset includes a comprehensive set of variables:

## Source of Data: 

You can download the train and test data in csv format here - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fml-kaggle-challenge-credit-score-classification/data

## Evaluation
The evaluation section describes how submissions will be scored and how participants should format their submissions. You don't need a sub-title at the top; the page title appears above. Below is an example of a typical evaluation page. Submissions are evaluated on Accuracy Score between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission File
For each ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the TARGET variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
ID,TARGET
2,Standard
5,Poor
6,Good
etc.

## Methodology
We implemented and evaluated several machine learning methods including Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, KNN, Gaussian NB, Light GBM, and Neural Networks. The project involved extensive exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, scaling and encoding, and feature selection. We utilized Python and tools like Colab for our analyses.

## Results
Our models were rigorously tested and tuned, with the Random Forest model performing the best in terms of accuracy. The project journey encompassed different feature combinations, model testing, and preprocessing techniques. The final best-performing Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 0.814857 on the validation set and 0.8227 on the test set.
